Exercise 1.8
===========================
Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is given by the value

#(x/y^2 + 2y)/3




Answer
==============================

    (define (countCubeRoot x precision)
        (countCubeRootLoop x (nextGuess x 1.0) 1.0 precision))
    
    (define (countCubeRootLoop original guess lastGuess precision)
        (if (goodEnough guess lastGuess precision)
            guess
            (countCubeRootLoop original (nextGuess original guess) guess precision)))
    
    (define (sqr y)
        (* y y))
    
    (define (goodEnough guess lastGuess precision)
        (< (/ (abs (- guess lastGuess)) lastGuess) precision))
     
    (define (nextGuess original y)
        (/ (+ (/ original (sqr y)) (* 2 y)) 3))
